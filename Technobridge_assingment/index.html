                        <ul>
                            <li>Many companies will market their systems or services as “powered by AI” when it's not often the case. We will always find these instances of gimmicky marketing, so it is helpful to first understand what is AI and ML, and the different terms, as there are many relevant use cases of AI and ML in our world today. </li>
                                
                               <li>Artificial Intelligence is a technique for building systems that mimic human behavior or decision-making. 

                                Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses data to solve tasks. These solvers are trained models of data that learn based on the information provided to them. This information is derived from probability theory and linear algebra. ML algorithms use our data to learn and automatically solve predictive tasks. 
                                
                                Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning which relies on multilayered neural networks to solve these tasks.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>In supervised machine learning, we know about the data and the problem. Think of it as, “given a set of features x, we know the value of y,” and so in supervised learning, we create a function that approximates results based on some set of data. 

                                There are two kinds of supervised learning: classification and regression. In a classification problem, we assign data to categories. For example, given a client’s medical information, they test positive or negative for diabetes. In classifications, our trained models, known as classifiers, classify data points into different groups. 
                                
                                If we instead wanted to solve a different problem, like predicting the future value of GameStop stock given the stock market history, we'd turn to a regression. In regression, we return numerical values. Given some sentences, this is the percent likelihood the person is happy or sad. </li><br>
                            <li>In unsupervised machine learning, our data is unlabelled. There are two forms of unsupervised machine learning: clustering and dimension reduction. 

                                In clustering, we learn more about data points as they are clustered, or grouped together. This allows learned models to understand a data set, detect anomalies, and assign relationships between points, often allowing users to develop new categories or features about the data set. 
                                
                                In dimension reduction, we plot data points across different dimensions and feature sets to understand our data sets. This allows for techniques like feature selection or transformation. Dimension reduction solves the curse of dimensionality. The more features to a data set, the more data is needed, and processing many noisy features can impact the performance of an ML model, so unsupervised machine learning techniques are often paired with supervised or reinforcement learning algorithms.</li><br>
                            <li>In reinforcement learning (RL), we are learning models over time. A common technique is to utilize deep learning with reinforcement learning to derive relationships between features of a data set that may not otherwise be solved through human research. Deep learning RL has been very successful in the field of medicine as of late.</li>
